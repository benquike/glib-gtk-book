\chapter{Object-Oriented Programming in C}
\label{gobject}

Although the C language is not object-oriented, it is possible to write ``semi-object-oriented'' C code easily, and the GObject library provides more advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features such as interfaces, virtual functions, inheritance. Beyond OOP, GObject provides a powerful signal system, which belongs more to the Event-Driven Programming paradigm.
